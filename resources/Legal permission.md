## Do the Official Terms Align with Our Summary?

Yes. Both the Gemma and Llama licensing texts you provided confirm the key points we discussed:

---

### Google Gemma Terms of Use

1. **“You may use, reproduce, modify, Distribute… Gemma or Model Derivatives only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.”**
   – Section 2.2 permits all forms of use, reproduction, modification, display, and distribution so long as you comply with the Terms (i.e. include the Agreement, notices, etc.).【Gemma § 2.2】

2. **Distribution Conditions (Section 3.1):**

   * You must include the use-restrictions from Section 3.2 in any sublicense or user agreement.
   * You must provide recipients with a copy of the Gemma Terms.
   * You must add a “Gemma is provided under and subject to the Gemma Terms of Use…” notice file.
     These requirements simply mirror a standard attribution-and-notice obligation, akin to CC BY’s “must retain license and notices” rule. 【Gemma § 3.1(a–d)】

3. **Outputs Are Yours:**

   * **“Google claims no rights in Outputs you generate using Gemma.”**
   * They explicitly separate *Outputs* from *Model Derivatives*, so anything Gemma produces (the synthetic Q\&A) is free for you to use, share, or include in your dataset without further permission. 【Gemma § 1.1(e–f), 3.3】

4. **No Competing-Model Clause:**

   * The only substantive restriction is to avoid “Prohibited Uses” (e.g. illegal or unsafe applications) per the separate Prohibited Use Policy. There is **no ban** on using Gemma’s outputs to train or bootstrap another model.

> **Conclusion:** The Gemma Terms explicitly permit you to generate outputs, include them in your own dataset, and distribute or fine-tune derivatives—provided you carry forward the Agreement and notices. This matches our summary that Gemma is fully open for your intended workflow.

### Meta Llama 4 Community License

1. **Broad Usage Rights (Section 1.a):**

   * “You are granted … a royalty-free limited license … to use, reproduce, distribute, copy, create derivative works of, and make modifications to the Llama Materials.”
   * This clearly allows you to generate Q\&A outputs from Llama and use them however you wish in a training dataset. 【Llama § 1(a–b.i.A)}

2. **Distribution & Attribution (Section 1.b.i–iii):**

   * If you distribute Llama Materials or derivatives, you must:

     1. Provide a copy of the Llama Community License Agreement.
     2. Display “Built with Llama” on your product’s UI or documentation.
     3. Prefix any fine-tuned model name with “Llama.”
     4. Include a NOTICE text file stating “Llama 4 is licensed under the Llama 4 Community License…”
   * These are attribution‐style requirements—**not** a share-alike forcing your derivatives to carry the same license beyond the Notice requirement. 【Llama § 1.b.i–iii】

3. **Acceptable Use & Scale Threshold (Section 1.b.iv & 2):**

   * You must comply with Meta’s Acceptable Use Policy, and if you exceed 700 million MAUs you need a special license. Neither of these impacts a small ministry project.

> **Conclusion:** Llama’s license similarly grants you full freedom to generate and use Outputs for any purpose, including training. You only need to include the license text, attribution notices, and “Built with Llama” signage. This aligns with our earlier description that Llama is open for derivative use with straightforward attribution requirements.

### Overall Alignment

* **Gemma Terms of Use** require notice and license-copy distribution but place **no limit** on using outputs for downstream training or open-sourcing derivatives.
* **Llama 4 Community License** grants broad rights to use and modify, with an attribution-and-notice requirement and a trivial scale rule that doesn’t apply to your ministry.

Both sets of terms **fully support** using the models to **generate your Q\&A dataset**, fine-tuning a derivative model, and then **open-sourcing** that model—exactly as we discussed.
