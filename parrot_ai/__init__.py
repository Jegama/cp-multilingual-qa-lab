"""ParrotAI package public API.

We keep imports light so that users performing only evaluation / HF API usage
don't need heavy local model deps (torch, transformers, bitsandbytes) installed.

``ParrotAI`` (local) still available via standard import; its heavy deps are
now lazily imported inside ``ParrotAI.load_model`` (see ``core.py``).
